Google App Engine is excelent technology but there is a lot of obstacles one
has to overcome to start real Python project on it.

If you are missing

* use of pip with Google App Engine,
* cooperation of appengine and virtualenv,
* single python way to add a path to sys.paths,

then this barebone could be at least an inspiration.
